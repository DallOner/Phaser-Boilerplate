> Notice: This repository continues updating the Phaser CE library as it comes out or as I find out about a new version. The future of this boilerplate is uncertain since we do not know the future success / failure of Phaser 3. At the moment for personal use I continue with this and recommending the use of the CE version. Version 3 is solid but very green in terms of Docs, tutorials and interested in the subject (At the time I write this) It is also advisable to try it and each one will draw their own conclusions.
